            UT Marketplace (UTMP) is a student-run platform designed to help University of Texas students buy and sell
            items safely within the campus community. By connecting verified UT users, UTMP makes it easier to find
            affordable items nearby while promoting reuse and reducing waste. Our goal is to create a convenient,
            trustworthy marketplace built specifically for Longhorns.
