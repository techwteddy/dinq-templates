## 🛠️ Key Changes & Features

### 1. Unified Admin Dashboard

The dashboard at `/dashboard/admin` has been entirely refactored to use a modular structure. It includes:

- **Overview**: Real-time stats cards (Total Users, Plants, Adoptions, etc.).
- **User Management**: A table to view all users with the ability to **Ban/Unban** in one click.
- **NGO Verification**: A queue for reviewing and **Approvig/Rejecting** pending NGO registrations.
- **Report Management**: A dedicated tab to view and resolve/dismiss user reports.

### 2. Malicious Activity Reporting

A new reporting system was implemented to allow users and NGOs to report suspicious behavior:

- **Backend**: Created the `user_reports` table and endpoints.
- **Frontend**: Added "🚩 Report" buttons to adoption cards for both Adopters and NGOs.
- **Modal**: A custom `ReportUserModal` with category selection (Spam, Harassment, Fake NGO, etc.).

### 3. Authentication & Security

- **Route Guards**: The admin dashboard is strictly protected; non-admin users are automatically redirected to their respective dashboards or the login page.
- **Smart Redirects**: The root landing page now intelligently redirects logged-in users based on their role (Admin → Dashboard, NGO → NGO Dashboard, Adopter → My Adoptions).

### 4. Design System

- **Premium Emerald Theme**: Custom CSS utilities in `globals.css` provide a sleek, modern look using emerald greens and modern typography.
- **Interactive UI**: Added smooth animations (fadeIn, slideUp), custom stat cards, and responsive tables.
