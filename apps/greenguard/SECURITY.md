   - Detailed step-by-step instructions or proof of concept to reproduce the issue.

## 🔑 Hardening Your Local Workspace

We strongly recommend all contributors harden their Git workflows and local terminals when contributing code.

- **Enable Commit Signing**: Ensure all your commits are cryptographically verified. Read our [Security Key & Git Authentication Setup Guide](docs/SECURITY_KEY_SETUP.md) for a step-by-step tutorial on using hardware keys (YubiKeys) or standard SSH keys to securely sign your commits.
- **Environment Secrets**: Never commit `.env` files. Always populate values locally using `.env.example` as a template, and keep production tokens (such as Google Gemini API keys and Supabase SERVICE_ROLE_KEYs) stored in safe cloud secrets managers.
