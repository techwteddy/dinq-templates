# CLAUDE.md - Daily Prospect Tracker (Open Source)

## Brain Logging

After completing any feature, bug fix, or significant change, automatically save a summary to Tony's brain using the `mcp__tony-brain__save_to_brain` tool with source "claude-code". Include what was changed, why, and which files were affected. Do not wait for the user to ask -- do this proactively at the end of each completed task.

## What This Project Is

**Daily Prospect Tracker** is a free, open source, mobile-first sales activity tracker for real estate agents and sales teams. It lives at `lokiverde/daily-prospect-tracker` on GitHub.

**Two purposes this project serves:**

1. **Open source giveaway** -- Any broker-owner or team leader can clone it, deploy it to their own Supabase and Vercel accounts, and run it for free. The code is the door opener.

2. **Consulting lead generator** -- Tony Self (Harcourts Hunter Mason, South Bay LA) implements this for broker-owners and team leaders at $3,500-$7,500 per engagement. The software is free. Tony's 30 years of brokerage operations knowledge is what they're actually paying for.

**What this is NOT:**
- Not a SaaS product (that is salesgamify.com -- completely separate project)
- Not a private brokerage tool (that is tracker.huntermason.com -- completely separate project)
- Not a product Tony hosts for clients -- clients run it in their own infrastructure
- **No public hosted demo.** The prior demo at `daily-prospect-tracker.vercel.app` has been taken down. Do not re-deploy a public demo without Tony's explicit direction.

---

## The Consulting Model (Critical Context)

When a broker-owner or team leader wants this set up:

1. **Zoom call 1 (1 hour):** Tony helps them create their own Supabase account and Vercel account. Discovery conversation: how many agents, team structure, current tracking method.
2. **Tony works offline in Claude Code** against their Supabase credentials. Customizes activity types, point values, agent roster, brokerage name and colors.
3. **Zoom call 2 (1 hour):** Walkthrough, agent training, handoff.
4. **Optional:** Monthly support retainer.

**Infrastructure rule:** Everything lives in the CLIENT'S accounts. Tony never hosts client data. Tony gets added as a collaborator, does the work, then optionally stays on retainer.

**Why Tony can charge $3,500-$7,500 for free software:**
- Any engineer can rebuild the code. Nobody can replicate 30 years of knowing why agents stop logging after week two, why leaderboards create resentment in some offices and accountability in others, why point systems have to feel fair to stick.
- Tony's brokerage operator experience is the actual product. The code just proves it works.

## Deploy to Vercel Button

Every broker-owner who sees this repo should be able to hand their phone to their office manager and say "deploy this." The README includes a one-click Deploy to Vercel button.

**What happens when someone clicks Deploy to Vercel:**
1. Vercel forks the repo into their GitHub account
2. Vercel prompts for environment variables (Supabase URL + keys)
3. Vercel deploys automatically
4. App loads at their Vercel URL
5. A first-run /setup wizard walks them through creating the first admin account and seeding their agent roster

**The /setup wizard is still pending work.** Manual setup steps are documented in README.md until the wizard is built.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 14+ (App Router) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS) |
| Hosting | Vercel |
| Repo | GitHub (lokiverde/daily-prospect-tracker, public) |

## Critical Architecture Notes (Preserve These)

**Timezone handling:** All date boundaries computed server-side in the brokerage's IANA timezone (stored in `brokerages.settings.timezone`). Helper functions in `src/lib/calculations.ts` accept an optional timezone parameter.

**RLS policies:** Use SECURITY DEFINER helper functions (`get_user_role()`, `get_user_team_id()`, etc.) to prevent infinite recursion from cross-table policy references.

**Never use `search_path = ''`** on functions that call `auth.uid()`. Use `SET search_path = 'public', 'auth'` instead.

**Multi-tenant from day one:** The schema supports multiple brokerages. Each client deployment is their own Supabase project, so tenant isolation is handled at the infrastructure level -- but the schema should still be clean for single-tenant use.

## Point System

**Daily goal: 80 points = one full productive workday**

| Activity | Points | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Open Escrow | +50 | Top value activity |
| Take Listing | +25 | |
| Write Offer | +25 | |
| Client Appointment (in-person) | +20 | |
| Set Appointment (with date) | +15 | |
| Open House | +12 | |
| Show Home | +8 | |
| Networking Event | +8 | |
| Review Received | +15 | |
| Post Video | +10 | |
| CMA Sent | +10 | |
| Request Client Review | +8 | |
| Referral Given or Received | +15 | |
| Door Knock | +5 | |
| Phone Call | +4 | |
| Follow-Up Call to Active Lead | +4 | |
| SOI Call | +4 | |
| Email/DM | +2 | |
| Voicemail Left | +2 | |
| Text Message | +1 | Max 30/day (30-point cap) |
| Weekly Sales Meeting | +10 | |
| Daily Huddle | +5 | |
| Agent Training | +5 | |

**Anti-gaming:** Text messages capped at 30/day. Back-dating limited to 5 days.

**Leaderboard display:** Percentage of daily goal achieved, not raw points. Agent at 95% beats agent at 80% even if raw points differ. Keeps competition fair across different markets.

## Build Priority Order

### Priority 1 -- README and Deploy Button
1. Keep README.md clean: what this is, who it's for, how to self-deploy
2. Keep Deploy to Vercel button working
3. Document environment variables clearly
4. Keep manual setup steps for the first-run experience
5. Add screenshots of the leaderboard and activity logging screen

### Priority 2 -- First-Run Setup Wizard (/setup route)
1. Detect if no admin account exists
2. Walk new deployer through: create admin account, set brokerage name, seed default activities
3. Redirect to dashboard when complete
4. This is what makes cold deployment work for non-technical broker-owners

### Priority 3 -- Polish and Open Source Release
1. MIT license confirmed (already in repo)
2. Contributing guidelines
3. Issue templates for feature requests
4. GitHub Actions for CI (lint + build check on PR)

## Design Principles

- Mobile-first -- 90% of use is on phones
- 30-second input -- large tap targets, no typing required
- Minimum tap targets: 48x48px
- No modals on mobile -- use full-screen pages
- Animate point changes for satisfying feedback
- Leaderboard always shows percentage of goal, never raw points
- No em-dashes anywhere in user-facing text or code comments

---

## What Success Looks Like

**For open source release:**
- [ ] README explains the product clearly to a non-technical broker-owner
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel button works and produces a running app
- [ ] Environment variable setup is documented with screenshots
- [ ] MIT license is in place
- [ ] First-run /setup wizard guides cold deployers to a working app

## Relationship to Other Projects

| Project | What It Is | Infrastructure |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| daily-prospect-tracker (this) | Open source, free, consulting lead gen | Client's own Supabase + Vercel |
| tracker.huntermason.com | Private HM brokerage tool, never touched | Tony's Supabase + Vercel |
| salesgamify.com | Paid SaaS, Stripe billing, Beowulf mascot | Tony's separate Supabase + Vercel |

These three projects never share infrastructure, databases, or code directly. Reference patterns across them -- never copy files between them.

## Notes for Claude Code

- No public hosted demo. The prior `daily-prospect-tracker.vercel.app` Vercel project has been deleted. Do not re-deploy a public demo.
- The consulting CTA in the README should link to Tony's calendar or contact page (ask Tony for the URL before adding a CTA anywhere).
- Demo/keynote traffic is now routed to salesgamify.com (paid SaaS). This open source repo exists for self-hosters and consulting leads only.
- The leaderboard percentage calculation is the signature mechanic -- make sure it is correct in any future work.
- Never use em-dashes anywhere.
