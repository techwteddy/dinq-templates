          Welcome to the VersaCode documentation. Here you will find guides and API references for using and extending the IDE. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for both users and contributors.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          To get started with VersaCode, simply navigate to the <a href="/editor">Editor</a>. The IDE is designed to be intuitive, with a familiar layout for anyone who has used modern code editors. The file explorer on the left provides a view of a virtual file system, which is persisted in your browser's local storage, so your work is saved between sessions.
        </p>
