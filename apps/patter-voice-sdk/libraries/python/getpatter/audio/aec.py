"""Acoustic echo cancellation for speakerphone telephony.

The pipeline-mode VAD runs on the inbound mic stream. On a speakerphone
or laptop-mic deployment, the agent's outbound TTS leaks back into the
mic — VAD then sees continuous voice-like energy from the bleed and
cannot detect when the caller starts speaking. The barge-in only fires
during natural pauses in the TTS, which produces the intermittent
"interrupt sometimes works, other times the agent keeps talking" symptom.

This module implements an NLMS (normalised least-mean-squares) adaptive
filter that subtracts the estimated echo from the inbound signal. It is
NOT a drop-in replacement for production-grade echo cancellation
(WebRTC's AEC3, Speex AEC). For tight integration with battle-tested
DSP, wrap a binding to ``libwebrtc-audio-processing`` externally.

Wiring::

    aec = NlmsEchoCanceller(sample_rate=16000)
    # In TTS path: every chunk we ship to the carrier is also fed to AEC.
    aec.push_far_end(tts_pcm_bytes)
    # In mic path: subtract estimated echo before VAD/STT.
    cleaned = aec.process_near_end(mic_pcm_bytes)
