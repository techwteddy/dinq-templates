"""Namespaced streaming STT adapters for Patter pipeline mode.

Each submodule exposes a thin ``STT`` subclass of the corresponding provider
adapter with:

* An environment-variable fallback on ``api_key``.
* A clear error message when credentials are missing.

Usage::

    from getpatter.stt import deepgram
    stt = deepgram.STT()  # reads DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
