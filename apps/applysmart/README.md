## 💡 What is ApplySmart?

ApplySmart is a Tinder-style job discovery platform designed to reduce job-hunting stress for fresh graduates.  
Instead of scrolling through endless job boards, users swipe through personalized job cards and apply in one click.

Recruiters can also post job openings directly on the platform, making it a two-sided marketplace.
