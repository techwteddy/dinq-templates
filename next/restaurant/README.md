# Restaurant site template (Next.js + Vercel)

**Use this as a GitHub template:** see **[TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md)** for the full checklist (env vars, content to replace, deploy).

**Demo / live example:** [restaurant-template-dfk.vercel.app](https://restaurant-template-dfk.vercel.app).

---

Brand, contact, social, SEO, and JSON-LD are driven by **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` environment variables** (see `.env.example`). After creating a new repo from the template, copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`, fill in your values, and mirror them in Vercel.

This codebase was originally built for **Desi Flavors Katy** (Indian street food in Katy, Texas). Fork it, change the env and content, and make it yours.

If you are a developer: hi, thanks for reading. If you are here because someone dropped a GitHub link in your lap with zero explanation: also hi. The food is real, the truck is real, and the menu has opinions.

## What is actually on the site

- **Home** - Photos, energy, and a reason to stay longer than five seconds  
- **Menu** - Full spread with vegetarian flags, heat warnings, and the occasional item that will judge you if you order mild  
- **About** - The story, the truck, the “why Katy?” energy  
- **Catering** - For when your office or your cousin’s wedding needs trays, not tiny samples  
- **Order** - Big friendly buttons that send people to Square and the delivery apps so nobody gets lost  

We are not trying to win a minimalist yourgn award for an empty white page. We are trying to make you hungry and then hand you a link.

## Stack, but make it quick

Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind, Framer Motion when a section needs a little drama, and Vercel for hosting. No separate “upload the `out/` folder” step-`git push` and let Vercel run `next build`. If you wanted a forty-bullet architecture doc, wrong README; this one believes in sunlight and garlic.

## Run it on your machine

You need Node.js. Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your terminal will nag you with a URL-usually `http://localhost:3000`. Open it. Hot reload will do its thing while you pretend you are not refreshing every twelve seconds.

Production build (same command Vercel runs):

```bash
npm run build
```

Optional: `npm start` after a build to smoke-test the production server locally.

## Secrets and env files

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add at least `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` if you want maps to work locally. Optional: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` for Search Console-see `GOOGLE_VERIFICATION_SETUP.md` if you are setting that up.

## Deploy

**Vercel** is the happy path: push, build, done. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your production URL (and your custom domain when you add one) so Open Graph, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` stay correct.

## Cool people disclaimer

Contributions and issues are welcome if you are fixing a bug or making the experience better for guests. Drive-by refactors that “simplify” the brand voice into corporate oatmeal will be read with the same suspicion as unsalted butter.

## License

Released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You can use this template for your own restaurant, client work, or learning-just keep the copyright and license notice in copies of the source you distribute. If you fork for a new brand, updating the copyright line in `LICENSE` for your own project is fine.

**Order link** is configured with `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORDER_URL` (e.g. Square, Toast, or your ordering page).
