# 🔍 Google Search Console Verification Setup Guide

## Step 1: Get Your Verification Code

### Option A: If You Already Have Google Search Console
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Click "Add Property"
3. Enter your website URL: `https://restaurant-template-dfk.vercel.app`
4. Choose verification method: **HTML tag**
5. Copy the code that looks like: `<meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE_HERE" />`
6. Extract just the code part (the long string after `content="` and before `"`)

### Option B: If You Don't Have Google Search Console Yet
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with your Google account (use your business email)
3. Click "Start Now" or "Add Property"
4. Choose "URL prefix" property type
5. Enter: `https://restaurant-template-dfk.vercel.app`
6. Click "Continue"
7. Select "HTML tag" verification method
8. Copy your verification code

**Example of what you'll see:**
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="abc123XYZ456..." />
```

**The code you need is:** `abc123XYZ456...` (the part between the quotes after `content=`)

---

## Step 2: Add Code to Your Website

### File to Edit: `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Current code (line 79-81):**
```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'your-google-verification-code',  // ← REPLACE THIS
},
```

**Replace with:**
```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'abc123XYZ456...',  // ← YOUR ACTUAL CODE HERE
},
```

### Example:
If Google gives you this:
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="j5K9mP3nL8xR2wQ7fD1vS4hY6gT9uE0aW5bN8cM3zX1" />
```

Your code should look like:
```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'j5K9mP3nL8xR2wQ7fD1vS4hY6gT9uE0aW5bN8cM3zX1',
},
```

### 3. Verify in Google Search Console
1. Go back to Google Search Console
2. Click "Verify"
3. Google will check your site for the meta tag
4. Success! ✅ You should see "Ownership verified"

## Step 4: Submit Your Sitemap

## Troubleshooting

### "Verification Failed"

- Wait 5 minutes and try again
- Clear your browser cache
- Check that the code matches exactly (no extra spaces)

### "Property Already Verified by Another User"
- If you previously verified with a different Google account
- Add your new Google account as an owner
- Or contact the original verifier

### "Meta Tag Not Found"
- Check that you saved the file
- Run `npm run build` to rebuild
- Deploy the new build
