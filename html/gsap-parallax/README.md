Scrolling is no longer just navigation; it is a storytelling tool. This project is a technical exploration of **Scroll-Triggered Animation Matrices**, utilizing the **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)** to decouple element movement from the standard scroll speed. By managing multiple depth planes, I created a cinematic sense of immersion while maintaining strict performance benchmarks.

## 🚀 Engineering Mindset

This project focuses on **Computational Motion & Interaction**:

*   **GSAP Orchestration:** Utilizing GSAP's timeline and `ScrollTrigger` capabilities to synchronize complex multi-element transitions with user input.
*   **Differential Motion Physics:** Implementing varied scroll velocities across multiple layers to simulate realistic 3D depth perception on a 2D plane.
*   **Memory-Efficient Rendering:** Leveraging CSS `will-change` properties and GPU-accelerated transforms to ensure smooth 60fps animations, preventing "scroll-jacking" lag.
*   **Dynamic Viewport Calculation:** Calculating element start/end positions based on real-time viewport dimensions for a consistent experience across all screen resolutions.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Multi-Layered Parallax:** A deep-dive into Z-axis simulation using differential scroll speeds.
*   **Fluid GSAP Timelines:** Precision-timed animations that respond dynamically to scroll direction and velocity.
*   **Responsive Motion Design:** Scalable animation logic that adapts to mobile, tablet, and ultra-wide displays.

## 🔧 Technical Stack

*   **HTML5 & CSS3:** Semantic structure and layout foundations.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic for interaction and state management.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock):** Industry-standard engine for high-performance motion.
