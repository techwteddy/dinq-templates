### Basic Enhancement (Copy-Paste This)

```
I have an existing Next.js site. Enhance it with motion-primitives-website:

- Replace hero with SpotlightHero (keep my text)
- Replace buttons with MagneticButton
- Convert feature cards to TiltCard in BentoGrid
- Add FadeIn animation to sections
- Add Lenis smooth scroll
- Add GoogleAnalytics (G-XXXXX)

Keep my existing colors and layout. Don't change navigation.
```

### Template Prompt

```
I have an existing [FRAMEWORK] site at [PATH/URL]. Enhance it with motion-primitives-website:

Current issues:
- [List what's wrong or boring]

Add these enhancements:
- [Specific components/effects]

Keep:
- [What should stay the same]

Don't:
- [What to avoid]
```

### Example: Make Hero Section Premium

```
I have an existing Next.js site. The hero section is boring - just text and a button.

Enhance it with motion-primitives-website:
- Add Spotlight background effect behind the hero
- Replace the button with MagneticButton
- Add TextGenerateEffect to the headline
- Add subtle FadeIn animation to the description

Keep the same text content and colors. Don't change the layout structure.
```

### Example: Add Animations to Cards

```
My site has a features section with 6 plain cards. Make them premium:

- Convert to BentoGrid layout (2 large, 4 small)
- Add TiltCard effect on hover
- Use FeatureIcon for the icons (not generic rounded boxes)
- Add StaggerOnScroll so they animate in one by one

Keep the same content. Match my existing dark theme.
```

### Example: Improve Scroll Experience

```
My landing page feels static. Add scroll-based enhancements:

- Add Lenis smooth scrolling
- Add ScrollProgress bar at the top
- Make sections FadeIn as they enter viewport
- Add Parallax effect to the hero image
- Use VelocityText for a large scrolling tagline between sections

Don't slow down page load. Keep it performant.
```

### Example: Add SEO to Existing Site

```
My SaaS site has no structured data. Add SEO infrastructure:

- Add SoftwareJsonLd to the homepage (product is $49/mo, 4.8 stars, 200 reviews)
- Add FAQJsonLd to the FAQ section (I have 8 questions)
- Add Breadcrumbs component to all pages
- Add GoogleAnalytics (my ID is G-ABC123)
- Add SEOAnalyzer so I can audit pages in dev mode
- Add SocialShare buttons to the blog posts

Don't change any visual design.
```

### Example: Fix Generic AI Look

```
My site was built with Cursor/v0 and looks like every other AI-generated site.

Replace these generic elements with motion-primitives-website:
- The rounded gradient icon boxes → use FeatureIcon or IconButton instead
- The basic buttons → use MagneticButton or ShinyButton
- The plain cards → use GlowCard or TiltCard
- The static hero → add Spotlight background

Keep the layout. Just make it look less "template-y".
```

### Example: Add Dark Mode

```
My site is light-only. Add proper dark mode:

- Wrap app with ThemeProvider
- Add ThemeToggle to the navbar
- Make sure all motion-primitives-website components respect the theme

Current colors: white background, black text, purple accent.
Dark mode should: black background, white text, keep purple accent.
```

### Example: Enhance Blog Post Pages

```
My blog posts are plain. Enhance the reading experience:

- Add ArticleJsonLd for SEO
- Add Breadcrumbs at the top
- Add ScrollProgress indicator
- Add SocialShare buttons at the end
- Add CharacterReveal on the title
- Add ImageReveal on the hero image

Keep the content and layout. Just add polish.
```
